# Week 2 TASKS

## Week 2 Assignment
A change this week! You have been assigned groups to work with. Find your groups in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u9QVW0PpTno4jXh7bDajUXJOC_3LUGvOPvMpTGdEJH0/edit?usp=sharing)

This Week 2 assignment will give you hands-on practice with:

### Supervised Learning and Regression Models
- Understanding the difference between **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning  
- Implementing **linear** and **polynomial regression** models  
- **Evaluating model performance** using appropriate metrics (e.g., RÂ² score, MAE, MSE)

### Neural Networks (Basics)
- Getting started with **neural network fundamentals**  
- Understanding the concept and mechanism of **backpropagation**  
- Exploring the **mathematics behind neural networks**, including forward pass and gradient computation

---

Take your time to experiment with the models and concepts. Use visualizations or code-based intuition to reinforce your understanding.

**Please submit your work by *May 29*.**

## Task 1: Familiarize with the Dataset
- You have been provided with a dataset - `mw_pw_profiles.csv` - matchwise playerwise dataset
- This is a large dataset with multiple features, familiarize yourself with the columns and their meanings.
- Think about how you could use various columns to develop your own features. 
- Play around in a notebook with **pandas** to explore the dataset.

## Task 2: Implement Linear Regression
- Implement a simple linear regression model using Python with the provided dataset (this is to be done from scratch without using any libraries like scikit-learn, pytorch, etc).
- Implement polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.

## Task 3: Implement Neural Networks on the Dataset
- Implement a neural network model using Python with the provided dataset (any architecture is fine)

## Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook:** `week2_exploration.ipynb` containing your explorations with the dataset.
- Linear Regression Model implemented from scratch: `linear_regression.py`
- Polynomial Regression Model implemented: `polynomial_regression.py`
- Neural Network Model implemented: `neural_network.py`
